# Morpion-TicTacToe-

10 days Ruby notions later and here we are, creating the infamous TicTacToe game !
It consists of making a sequence of three symbols in either a row, column or diagonal in a 3x3 board, using Ruby OOP principles.

This project was developed in peer programming with a part of the the Vocal_15 team : [@Bretchaa](https://github.com/Bretchaa) / [@linahello](https://github.com/linahello) / [@LoiseauB](https://github.com/LoiseauB) !
This was a project to do on day 4 of the second week of our Fullstack Bootcamp (Hi THP !)

### Launch the game on your terminal ###

```ruby
$ ruby app.rb
```

### Rules ###

Two players :
* Player 1 register and play with x
* Player 2 register and play with o

Cases :
* You choose where to play my naming a case with a letter for the column (A, B, C) and a number for the row (1, 2, 3) like "B3"

There is 8 ways to win :
* Align 3 identical symbols horizontally (3 possibilities)
* Same but vertical (3 possibilities)
* You do the same but on diagonal (2 possibilities)

Drawn :
* If the two players are on the same level, it's not possible to align 3 identical symbols on the board and the board is full.
